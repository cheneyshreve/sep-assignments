This exercise utilizes a stack to store data. Stacks use Last-in, First-out (LIFO) processing. The user can add to the stack using the push command, and remove from the stack using the pop command. The code is written to avoid using Ruby's pre-made commands push, pop, and empty. A pointer is maintained to the top of the stack. An example of a stack in everyday life is a stack of food trays, the last one stacked on top is the first one retrieved by the food server. Another example is the "back" vs "forward" navigation on a browser.

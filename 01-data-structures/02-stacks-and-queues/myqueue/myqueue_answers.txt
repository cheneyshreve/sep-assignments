The data structure for this exercise is a queue, which utilizes first-in, first-out (FIFO) data processing. The user can add data using the #enqueue method, which adds a new person to the line, and remove a person from the line via the #dequeue method. Methods were written to avoid using pre-made Ruby commands of push, pop, and empty. Pointers are maintained to the head and tail of the queue. An example of a queue in common usage is for providing a mechanism to manage server requests, as a single serve can't handle more than a fixed number of requests at a time. Another example is an actual queue (line) at any store, etc.

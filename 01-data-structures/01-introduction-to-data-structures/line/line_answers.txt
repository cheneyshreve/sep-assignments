When I first read the exercise description, I thought about a queue so I searched "queuing in Ruby", which brought up a discussion of 'stacking' versus 'queuing'. Since the exercise mentioned the person having the ability to leave at any time, a stacking approach seemed more appropriate than a queue approach ("first-in, first-out"), as the description for the queue describes only ever adding people to the back of the line.

When I first read the exercise description, I thought about a queue so I searched "queuing in Ruby", which brought up a discussion of 'stacking' ("last-in, first-out") versus 'queuing' ("first-in, first-out"). However, you can just use a an array for this exercise with push and pop methods for adding and removing people, which is also used in stacking/queuing, however, we add methods to this class for searching for individuals, and for the middle person in the line.

Questions:
How does your data structure allow developers to access and manipulate the data?
- data is accessed and manipulated using arrays

If a developer wanted to find a specific element in your data structure, how would you search for it?
- you can search by the person's name using the search method, or look for the first, middle, or last member's in the line calling first, middle and last methods

What other real-world data can each structure represent?
- arrays are used for a variety of real-world data situations, for a variety of different data types. For example, integers and floating point values are commonly stored in arrays for a variety of different scientific applications (image analysis, etc.).

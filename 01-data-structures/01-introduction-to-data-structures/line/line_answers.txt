When I first read the exercise description, I thought about a queue so I searched "queuing in Ruby", which brought up a discussion of 'stacking' ("last-in, first-out") versus 'queuing' ("first-in, first-out"). However, you can just use a an array for this exercise with push and pop methods for adding and removing people, which is also used in stacking/queuing, however, we add methods to this class for searching for individuals, and for the middle person in the line.

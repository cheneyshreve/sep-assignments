The two data structures I thought of for there were arrays and hashes. I decided on arrays because I do want the data to be ordered.

Questions:
How does your data structure allow developers to access and manipulate the data?
- data is stored in a 2D array. Users can add data using the #insert method, which takes in the pixel values (e.g. Red, Green, Blue) and

If a developer wanted to find a specific element in your data structure, how would you search for it?

- The user access the data via the (x,y) coordinates by calling the #at method and passing in valid x and y parameters, which returns the pixel data (e.g. Red,Green,Blue) values stored at that specific (x,y) location.

What other real-world data can each structure represent?
- There are a variety of real-world applications for array data, especially in computer programming when you need an indexed data structure. The added flexibility of being able to store different data types in the array (strings, integers, floating point values, etc.) makes them more versatile. In earlier work, I commonly used multidimensional arrays when working with satellite datasets.
